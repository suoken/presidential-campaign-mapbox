## The Problem

You are the new logistics manager for a 2020 US Presidential candidate. The 
campaign has identified a list of 256 cities that the candidate needs to visit
on the campaign trail.

Because of your candidate's eagerness to go green, a trait owing to their home
city of San Francisco, your task is to minimize the distance travelled 
by the campaign.

The outgoing logistics manager managed to plot a route that covered 119,950km
and while the candidate appreciates the reward miles, it was felt that a
better job could be done scheduling, and so the campaign now has a new
logistics manager.

The candidate insists that the tour ends in the same city it starts so they
can bookend their trip with a closing rally.

Your job for this task is to see if you can beat the previous logistics
manager's route distance starting and ending in San Francisco.

The output should be a list of all cities, beginning and ending in San
Francisco, as well as the total distance travelled.
